HOW TO INSTALL DJANGO AND POSTGRES

1. Install Python 3. Should be similar for Windows and Mac.
2. If your installation didn't do this for you, install pip. Should be automatically installed, if not consult Google for your system.
3. Go to a terminal and run "pip3 install django" or "pip install django" depending on if you either do have Python 2.x installed on your computer,
   or you don't, respectively. This should install the django package for you.
4. Now, exactly follow the instructions on https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/.
5. When you reach the end click on the next tutorial, alternatively visit https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial02/.
6. When you reach the "Database setup" header, stop and follow the next set of instructions:
    a) Visit https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads to download PostgreSQL.
    b) Use the wizard to install in an appropriate location.
    c) Visit https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ to download pgAdmin4.
    d) Follow the instructions to install pgAdmin4. It will prompt you to give a password for the default user "postgres". REMEMBER YOUR INPUT FOR THIS.
    e) Then, open pgAdmin4. Expand the "Servers" icon, double click "PostgreSQL 10" and login using the password you gave.
    f) You will see a Databases icon, expand that and right click on the database "postgres". Select the "Query Tool" option.
    g) In the newly added Query Window, type "create database database_name", where database_name is the name of your new database.
    h) In mysite/settings.py, replace the DATABASES line(s) with:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': 'database_name',
                'USER': 'postgres',
                'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
                'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
                'PORT': '5432',
            }
        }
